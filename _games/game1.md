My first game will be a little different from the one on this picture.

We have a manequin disguised in a dressing room in the background.

We have another maneuver that must be disguised as the one that turns in the dressing room.

For that the second character to the choice between several combinations of clothing / parts of the face. (Example: 3 eyes, 3 mouths, 3 shoes, ...)

A combination is proposed.
If it is correct, we will have won.
If it is false, a bar tells us how many righteous things we have done.
This process continues until the combination is found to be completely correct.s
