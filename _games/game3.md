This game is m'y favorite.
It is on PlayStation.

The game has more episodes. Each edition represents an event that has happened in history.

 - 1191             Croisades

 - 1715 - 1725      Piraterie
 - 1754 - 1783      Amériques
 - 1789             Révolution Française
 - 1868             ... et industrielle
 
 In each episode one incarnates a hero, or even a couple of heroes, in charge of fulfilling missions.
In general, they have the ultimate goal of eliminating one of their sworn enemies.

The Assassins in question are authentic characters of the Middle Ages. They were fanatid Musilmans, but their digital versions lost any reference to Islam.

The assassins have for their sworn enemies the Knights Templar, also historical characters with which the writers have taken great liberties. The mortal rivalry is fictitious between these two "secret societies" is at the heart of each episode.
