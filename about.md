#### Hey


This website is my learning project.  
I do an apprenticeship in computer sciences, specifically web developing.  
I do it at Liip's.  
  
What is Liip?
            
Liip is a web developing company where they develop website for several other companies.
It is a company that exists only in Switzerland.
Liip was formed by the union of two companies, one in Zurich and the other one in Fribourg.
It's been 10 years since Liip began.
For now there will be only one game but maybe the will depend on the difficulty of the first one.

These games created by me "with the help of my instructor" so be indulgent and try to recognize the work that is behind all that.
